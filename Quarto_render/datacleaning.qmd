## Cleaning the Dataset
```
# importing libraries
import pandas as pd 

# loading the data set
# df1 = pd.read_csv("./season1.csv")
# df2 = pd.read_csv("./season2.csv")
``` 

### Check for Missing Data
```
# looking for missing values in the columns 
# loop through each column and print the percentage of missing values of each column
print("Season1 Missings:")
for col in df1.columns:
    total = len(df1)
    missing = df1[col].isnull().sum()
    percent = (missing / total) * 100
    print(col , ":", round(percent, 2))

print("\nSeason2 Missings:")
for col in df2.columns:
    total = len(df2)
    missing = df2[col].isnull().sum()
    percent = (missing / total) * 100
    print(col , ":", round(percent, 2))
```
