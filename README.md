# DS-2023-Final-Project

## Description: Our Final Project task
Our goal was to analyze data from the UVA Menâ€™s Basketball Team and use our findings to provide a recommendation for their team moving forward. We started off with cleaning the two datasets we were given, from the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 seasons. We performed an Exploratory Data Visualization on both datasets to determine which variables we wanted to analyze and where the strong correlations and relationships were. 
Using the information we gathered, we created three graphs to serve as the visualizations that accompany our story. Our data visualization starts out with a donut chart looking at the three different positions and their average percentage of the Total Player Load in season 1. The second chart is a stacked area chart that looks at the contribution of IMA Acceleration and IMA Deceleration, Explosive Efforts, and IMA Jump Bands to Total Player Load, specifically for Athlete H in season 1. The third and final chart is a line chart that shows the cumulative Player Load over the course of season 1. 

## Reflection: What we learned from the Project

Through this project, we gained valuable experience across the entire data analysis pipeline from cleaning raw data to crafting a compelling narrative. We began by preparing the dataset for exploration, which involved identifying and removing noisy or incomplete features. 
As we progressed through exploratory data analysis, we learned the importance of examining variable relationships and identifying meaningful patterns. This process helped us develop focused questions that deepened our understanding of the data. Most importantly, we learned how to transform numbers into a cohesive story. Interpreting raw metrics can feel overwhelming, but by starting with detailed insights and gradually zooming out, we were able to construct a narrative that connected individual data points to broader trends and implications.

## Relevance: How is this pertinent to us as Data Scientists

This project gave our group valuable hands-on experience working with a large, complex dataset. One of the biggest challenges was identifying a compelling story that would resonate with our audience and have a measurable impact on team performance. Through trial and error, we explored relationships between variables, often discovering unexpected connections or a lack thereof. Beyond data analysis, this project strengthened our ability to collaborate effectively. By balancing diverse ideas and perspectives, we built a cohesive and dynamic narrative. As future Data Scientists, we will be expected to work collaboratively and build impactful stories on the data at hand. This experience has given us the tools to do just that.
